= pick

A Clojure library for HTTP server-driven content negotiation.

STATUS: Alpha. Maturing.

== Quick Start

Suppose you are writing a web service and want to provide proactive content
negotiation based on the accept headers in the client request. Suppose also that
you have established which representations you want to choose between.

A representation is a map that has a `:juxt.pick.alpha/representation-metadata`
containing its metadata.

The metadata can contain any, some or all of the following string keys:

* `"content-type"` -- the media-type and charset of the representation
* `"content-encoding"` -- how the representation has been encoded (e.g. `gzip`)
* `"content-language"` -- the natural language of the representation (e.g. `es`)

.An example representation
====
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[juxt.pick.alpha :as pick])

{
…
 ::pick/representation-metadata
 {"content-type" "text/html;charset=utf-8"
  "content-encoding" "gzip"
  "content-language" "en-US"}
…
}
----
====

You can use *pick* to select the representation that is most acceptable to the user agent.

Here's how:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
  '[juxt.pick.alpha.ring :refer [pick]]
  '[juxt.pick.alpha :as pick])

(pick
  ;; A ring request (where headers indicate preferences)
  {:request-method :get
   :uri "/"
   :headers {"accept" "text/html"
             "accept-language" "de"}}

  ;; Possible representations
  [{:id 1
    ::pick/representation-metadata
    {"content-type" "text/html;charset=utf-8"
     "content-language" "en"}}

   {:id 2
    ::pick/representation-metadata
    {"content-type" "text/html;charset=utf-8"
     "content-language" "de"}}

   {:id 3
    ::pick/representation-metadata
    {"content-type" "text/plain;charset=utf-8"}}])

=>
{:juxt.pick.alpha/representation {…} ; most acceptable representation
 :juxt.pick.alpha/representations […] ; all representations (scored)
}

== Introduction

Content negotiation is a feature of HTTP that allows different 'representations'
to be served from the same URI.

*pick* is a Clojure library that determines quality values of each of the
negotiable dimensions and corresponding rules specified in RFC 7231. These can
be used by content negotiation algorithms to determine the most appropriate
content to respond with.

*pick* _also_ includes a built-in reference implementation based on Apache's
 _de-facto_
 https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/content-negotiation.html#algorithm[content
 negotiation algorithm].

=== Problem Statement

Content negotiation is one of the primary ways that the web is
inclusive, supporting a wide range of user agents and other software-based
clients.

Content negotiation can also contribute to improved performance, by allowing the
compression of content for optimising network bandwidth and by cache
integration.

Also, since content negotiation allows for gradual migration from old to new
data formats it enables graceful and continuous improvement, balancing the needs
for both innovation and solid dependability.

However, while content negotiation is often used for static resources, which is
well implemented by web servers such as Apache's httpd and nginx, it is often
missing from, or poorly implemented by, the majority of web libraries and
frameworks.

=== API Reference

The `pick` function 3 arguments:

* The Ring request
* A collection of possible representations
* An option map

The option map supports the following entries:

[cols="3m,5"]
|===
|:juxt.pick.alpha/explain?|if truthy, provide an explain in the return value
|:juxt.pick.alpha/vary?|if truthy, compute the preferences that will vary the choice
|===

=== Alternatives

Most Clojure alternatives only deal with media-types, and perhaps charsets. Note
that *pick* fully implements _all_ proactive (server-driven) content negotiation
rules contained in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231[RFC 7231], including
media-types, charsets, encodings, languages, wildcards, qvalues and precedence
rules. Where not prescribed specifically by the RFC, *pick* adopts the
_de-facto_ decisions made by the Apache httpd engine.

https://github.com/ngrunwald/ring-middleware-format[ring-middleware-format] and
Metosin's https://github.com/metosin/muuntaja[Muuntaja] library negotiate
media-types and charsets, and perform automatic decoding/encoding of
request/response bodies

[CAUTION]
--
*pick* only provides the decision of which representation(s) to select,
given the context of an HTTP request and a set of representation to choose between.

Unlike Muuntaja, *pick* does _not_ include support for format transformation or coercion, which is considered _out of scope_ for this library.

== References

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231[RFC 7231] is the normative standard on content negotiation.

This https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation[MDN guide on content negotiation from Mozilla] is very informative.

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/content-negotiation.html#algorithm

While *pick* attempts to be reasonably performant, due to the per-request nature
of content negotiation some users may consider using a memoization strategy,
making use of a memoization library such as
https://github.com/clojure/core.memoize[clojure.core.memoize].
